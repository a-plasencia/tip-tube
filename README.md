# tip-tube

A full stack web application for users who want to chat about a specific video in realtime.

I created tip-tube because I wanted to try my hand at recreating a web application that was previously called flow-feedback.  My group of friends used to use flow-feedback to analyze Youtube videos and talk about them in detail, and I wanted to create a place that could replicate that experience.
## Live Demo
